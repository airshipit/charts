Installation
============

A vagrant file is provided under ``tools/deployment/vagrant``, running
``vagrant up`` from this directory should bring up and deploy a copy of the
Jarvis AIO.

.. note:: For Vagrant to work, a virtualization provider (e.g. ``Virtualbox``,
  ``libvirt``) is required. The recommended provider in the
  ``Vagrantfile`` is ``Virtualbox``, however, ``libvirt`` is included. To
  install ``Virtualbox``, see the instruction at
  `Virtualbox's page <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_.


.. note:: This document does not cover the installation of vagrant.
  Please refer to the instructions at
  `Vagrant's page <https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation>`_.
